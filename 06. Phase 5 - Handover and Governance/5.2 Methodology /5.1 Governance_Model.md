# Governance model 

The governance model defines how IAM decisions are made, monitored, and improved over time. 

- **IAM Center of Excellence (CoE):** Acts as the central decision body for IAM strategy, policies, and standards, under the sponsorship of CIO/CISO.
- **Governance committees :**
  
     - Strategic steering committee: validates roadmap, budget, and risk posture (meets quarterly).
     - Operational Governance forum: Reviews SLAs, incidents, and changes (meets monthly).
       
- **Decision domains:**

     - Policy and access governance: Approval of access  models, role design, certification frequency.
     - Technology and integration: Validation of changes to Entra ID, AD, Workday interation, Sentinel Dashboards.
  
- **RACI model:** Each key process (provisioning, access reviews, privileged access, incident response) is mapped with clear R,A,C,I roles for IAM CoE, IT Ops, Security, Business Units, and Microsoft as cloud provider.
