# Lessons learned 

The lessons learned section captures feedback from all phases (analysis, design, migration, go‑live) to improve future IAM initiatives.

- Methodology insights :
   - Early involvement of business stakeholders and clear business‑driven prioritization improved adoption and reduced rework.
   - Using a pilot‑first approach in a hybrid environment helped validate Entra ID + AD integration before scaling to critical OT/SCADA systems.

- Process and governance lessons:
   - Well‑defined joiner/mover/leaver processes and access reviews significantly reduced orphan accounts and audit findings.
   - Formalizing IAM CoE and governance forums avoided fragmented decisions and conflicting priorities between IT and business.

- Technical and operational lessons :
   - Close collaboration between BA, IAM architects, and IT Ops was essential to align business requirements with technical constraints.
   - Proactive monitoring via Sentinel and clear incident playbooks reduced mean time to detect and resolve IAM‑related incidents.

- Recommandations for future projects :

  - Maintain and regularly update the IAM roadmap as a living artifact, reflecting evolving business needs and regulatory changes.
  - Expand non‑human identity management and automate further lifecycle workflows as the environment matures.

These lessons are consolidated into a final report shared with the Steering Committee and IAM CoE, and are used to update governance documents, processes, and training materials for future cycles.
