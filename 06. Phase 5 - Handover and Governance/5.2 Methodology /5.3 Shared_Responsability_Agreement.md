# Shared responsibility agreement 

The shared responsibility agreement clarifies which responsibilities lie with the organization and which lie with Microsoft as cloud provider,
in line with the Azure shared responsibility model.

- **Organizational responsabilities:**
   - Identity lifecycle management (HR events, joiner/mover/leaver, non-human identities).
   - Configuration of Entra ID policies: conditional Access, MFA enablement, role assignements, and access governance rules.
   - Data and access governance: Defining who can access what, running access reviews, and enforcing least privilege.
   - Endpoint and application security: Patching of servers, applications, and client devices connected to the IAM ecosystem.
   - Incident response and user support: Handling security alerts, user access incidents, and communication with stakeholders.

- **Microsoft responsabilities:**
   - Security "of" the cloud: Physical datacenters, network, hypervisor, and core Entra ID/Sentinel platform reliability.
   - Platform availability and patching of cloud services (Entra ID, Sentinel), including service updates and resilience.
   - Compliance of cloud services with relevant standards and frameworks, as documented in Microsoft compliance offereings.

The agreement is formalized as an annex to the governance model, clearly mapping each control domain ( identity, data, infrastructure, applications, monitoring) to either "Customer", "Microsoft", or "Shared".
