# IAM Process 

IAM processes are documented end‑to‑end to ensure consistent execution across HR, IT, and Security teams.

Main standardized processes : 

- **Identity lifecycle (Joiner-Mover-Leaver):**
   - Joiner : HR event in Workday triggers automatic account creation in Entra ID/ AD and assignment of "birthright" access based on role and organizational unit.
   - Mover: Role or department changes automatically adjust group memberships, access packages, and remove obsolete rights.
   - Leaver: Termination event triggers immediate deactivation of all accounts and revocation of access in Entra ID, AD, and key applications.

 - **Access request and approval:**
    - Standard access: Managed via self-service portal (My Access / Entra ID Governance) with predefined approval workflows by managers abd application owners
    - Critical access: Routed via elevated workflows with additional approvals (Security/Compliance) and time-bound privileges. 
    
- **Access  reviews:**
   - Periodic reviews for high-risk apps and privileged roles, executed through Entra ID access reviews, with evidence stored for audit.

- **Privileged access management:**
   - Use of just-in-time privileged roles (PIM) instead of standing admin rights, with approval, justification, and logging.

As BA, the focus is on documenting these processes, aligning them with business needs, and ensuring they are understandable and adoptable by non-technical stakeholders.
