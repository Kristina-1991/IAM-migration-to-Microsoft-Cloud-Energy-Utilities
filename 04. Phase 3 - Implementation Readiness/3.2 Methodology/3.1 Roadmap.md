## Target Principles
- **Zero Trust by Design:** Continuous verification, adaptive authentication, and least privilege enforcement.  
- **Cloud-First:** IAM aligned with SaaS, hybrid, and cloud-native infrastructures.  
- **Automation Everywhere:** Lifecycle management for human and non-human identities.  
- **User-Centric:** Seamless, intuitive experiences for employees, partners, and customers.  
- **Compliance-Ready:** Built-in auditability, reporting, and regulatory alignment.  
- **Governance-Driven:** IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) ensures accountability and SLA enforcement.
