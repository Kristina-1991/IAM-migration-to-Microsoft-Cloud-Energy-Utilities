# Migration strategy 

**1. Strategic Objectives**
The migration strategy aims to transition the organization to the validated Best of Breed Hybrid IAM architecture while ensuring:

- Zero business disruption (<2% user impact during go-live)
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, NIS2) maintained throughout migration
- Progressive risk reduction through pilot-first validation
- Business value delivery per migration wave (measurable KPIs)

**2. Migration approach: Phased hybrid migration** 

Workday + Entra ID Governance + Sentinel (Cloud-Native)
↕ Hybrid Sync (Entra Connect)
Active Directory + Legacy OT/SCADA (On-Premises)

**Key Principles:**

- Pilot-first: Validate hybrid integration with 3 critical applications
- Wave-based: Group applications by business domain and technical similarity
- Parallel run: Maintain legacy authentication during cutover
- Rollback capability: Automated revert for first 2 waves

**3. Application priorization Matrix** 

| Priority | Wave   | Application Type  | Business Domain | Migration Complexity | Examples                 |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| P1       | Pilot  | Critical Business | Finance, HR     | Medium               | ERP Finance, Workday HR  |
| P2       | Wave 1 | Regulated         | Compliance      | High                 | SCADA OT, Legal Systems  |
| P3       | Wave 2 | Business Critical | Operations      | Medium               | CRM, Collaboration Tools |
| P4       | Wave 3 | Standard          | Productivity    | Low                  | Office 365, Email        |

**4. Migration waves timeline**

| Wave   | Sprint(s)     | Scope                | Success Criteria               | Duration     |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Pilot  | Sprints 11-12 | 3 P1 apps + 50 users | 95% SSO success, <1% incidents | Month 6      |
| Wave 1 | Sprints 13-16 | 15 P1/P2 apps        | 90% business req coverage      | Months 7-8   |
| Wave 2 | Sprints 17-20 | 25 P3 apps           | <2% disruption                 | Months 9-10  |
| Wave 3 | Sprints 21-24 | Remaining apps       | Full coverage                  | Months 11-12 |

**5. Technical migration sequence** 

1. Workday → Entra ID sync (HR source of truth)
2. Entra ID SSO + Conditional Access configuration
3. Entra Connect hybrid sync (AD ↔ Entra ID)
4. Entra ID Governance (access packages, reviews)
5. Sentinel integration + monitoring dashboards
6. Legacy AD federation for OT/SCADA

**6. Business validation Checkpoints**

| Checkpoint    | BA Validation             | Success Metric                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Pre-Pilot     | Business scope sign-off   | 100% stakeholder approval      |
| Post-Pilot    | User acceptance testing   | ≥90% business requirements met |
| Wave Complete | KPI dashboard review      | SLA compliance ≥95%            |
| Go-Live       | Executive business review | Business disruption <2%        |

**7. Rollback and contingency plans** 

- Pilot/Wave 1: Full rollback to legacy authentication (tested)
- Wave 2+: Selective app revert capability
- Critical Failure: Emergency AD-only fallback

**8. Success metrics and KPIs (BA owned)** 
| Category   | KPI                      | Target         |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Technical  | SSO Success Rate         | ≥98%           |
| Business   | Provisioning Time        | <24h           |
| User       | Helpdesk Calls Reduction | -40%           |
| Compliance | Access Review Completion | 100% quarterly |

**9. Governance & Escalation**

- Weekly BA-Technical sync for progress/risks
- Monthly Steering Committee for wave approval
- IAM CoE owns migration governance
- Shared Responsibility Model defines escalation paths
