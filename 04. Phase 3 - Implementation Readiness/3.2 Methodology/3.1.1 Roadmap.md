# Phase 3: Implementation Readiness - BA Roadmap 

As the Business Analyst leading Phase 3: Implementation Readiness through project closure, this roadmap outlines my strategic coordination activities, key deliverables, and collaboration framework to ensure business alignment throughout the IAM transformation.

## Roadmap Development Methodology
This roadmap was developed following the closure of Phase 2 governance meeting, leveraging validated deliverables (Future State Vision, Technical Design, Best of Breed Hybrid solution) to:

1. Prioritize business value - Applications selected based on criticality, user impact, and compliance requirements
2. Define clear business ownership - BA coordinates workshops with stakeholders while technical teams handle implementation
3. Establish measurable success criteria - Business KPIs defined for each phase (SLA approval rates, pilot validation, go-live disruption targets)
4. Ensure governance continuity - Weekly stakeholder syncs, monthly steering committee, bi-weekly risk reviews

**BA Role & Responsibilities**
My focus across all sprints:

- Business requirements validation - Ensure technical delivery meets validated Phase 2 scope
- Stakeholder alignment - Coordinate cross-functional workshops and executive reporting
- Risk & issue management - Track business risks, change requests, and mitigation actions
- Success measurement - Monitor business KPIs and validate value delivery per sprint

Key Principles
- Agile business validation - Each sprint delivers verifiable business value with stakeholder review
- Collaborative delivery - BA orchestrates while technical teams execute
- Risk-based progression - Pilot-first approach validates hybrid complexity before scale
- Governance-first - SLAs and IAM CoE established before technical migration

This BA-centric roadmap ensures the IAM transformation delivers measurable business outcomes while maintaining stakeholder alignment and governance excellence throughout the 9-month implementation journey.
