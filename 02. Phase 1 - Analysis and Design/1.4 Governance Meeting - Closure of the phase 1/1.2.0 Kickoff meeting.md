Proposed IAM Solution Overview
The IAM consulting team is proposing a comprehensive solution to modernize and strengthen your identity and access management framework, incorporating the following key components:

Migration to Microsoft Entra ID
Utilizing Microsoft Entra ID as the foundational platform, with features such as Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), automated provisioning, granular access control, and identity federation to streamline and secure authentication and authorization.

Clear and Standardized IAM Processes
Development of well-defined IAM workflows covering identity lifecycle, access requests and approvals, role-based access, and periodic reviews to increase compliance and automate critical tasks.

Establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence
Creating a governance body responsible for maintaining IAM policies, best practices, and continuous improvement initiatives while fostering collaboration among stakeholders.

Definition of Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
Establishing clear SLAs between IAM teams, business units, and IT to ensure accountability, quality of service, and effective incident management.

Implementation of a Shared Responsibility Model
Formalizing responsibility boundaries among the organization, cloud providers, and operational teams to improve risk management and security controls.

Management of Non-Human Identities
Integrating workload identity management for service accounts, IoT devices, and application identities to mitigate risks associated with non-human access.

Together, these solutions aim to close existing IAM gaps and build a secure, agile, and compliant identity management environment aligned with your organizational needs.
