# Meeting n°1: Project Charter Framing and BRD Draft

## Purpose of the Meeting 
The primary goal of this initial meeting was to focus on understanding the current context, reviewing key findings such as the pentester audit reports, incident reviews, and business process observations, and to validate a shared understanding of the situation among all stakeholders. This meeting served as an essential phase of alignment and preliminary framing, designed to avoid premature assumptions and biases before defining any migration plans.

It established a clear and common baseline from which the project team and client representatives could collaboratively ensure that all parties have the same vision of the current environment and challenges, setting the stage for a rigorous analysis to follow in the "Current State Assessment."
