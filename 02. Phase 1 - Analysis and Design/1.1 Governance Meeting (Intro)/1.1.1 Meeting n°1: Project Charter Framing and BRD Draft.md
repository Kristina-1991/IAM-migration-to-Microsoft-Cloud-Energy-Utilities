# Meeting n°1: Project Charter Framing and BRD Draft

## Purpose of the Meeting 
The primary goal of this initial meeting was to focus on understanding the current context, reviewing key findings such as the pentester audit reports, incident reviews, and business process observations, and to validate a shared understanding of the situation among all stakeholders. This meeting served as an essential phase of alignment and preliminary framing, designed to avoid premature assumptions and biases before defining any migration plans.

It established a clear and common baseline from which the project team and client representatives could collaboratively ensure that all parties have the same vision of the current environment and challenges, setting the stage for a rigorous analysis to follow in the "Current State Assessment."

  ## Key Discussion points
  - Current IAM limitations highlighted: legacy systems, fragmented directories, manual provisioning, unclear ownership, absence of SLAs causing operational inefficiencies and elevated risk exposure.
  - Validation of strategic objectives: modernization aligned with regulatory requirements (NIS2, ISO 27001, GDPR), establishment of clear SLAs, creation of IAM Center of Excellence, and formalization of a Shared Responsibility Model for cloud migration.
  - Emphasis on preparing a clear, accessible BRD capturing identity lifecycle needs, authentication and authorization requirements, and governance processes for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
 
  ## Next steps

  - The consulting team will finalize and deliver the formal Project Charter document.
  - Begin drafting the Business Requirements Document capturing detailed operational and governance requirements.
  - Prepare for the project kickoff meeting with a unified vision and documented agreements.

This first meeting established a solid foundation, transforming high-level ambitions into concrete commitments and setting the stage for a successful IAM migration project.
