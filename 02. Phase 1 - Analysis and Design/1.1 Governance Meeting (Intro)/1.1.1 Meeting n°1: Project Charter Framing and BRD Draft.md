# Meeting n°1: Project Charter Framing and BRD Draft

## Purpose of the Meeting 
The primary goal of this initial meeting was to focus on understanding the current context, reviewing key findings such as the pentester audit reports, incident reviews, and business process observations, and to validate a shared understanding of the situation among all stakeholders. This meeting served as an essential phase of alignment and preliminary framing, designed to avoid premature assumptions and biases before defining any migration plans.

It established a clear and common baseline from which the project team and client representatives could collaboratively ensure that all parties have the same vision of the current environment and challenges, setting the stage for a rigorous analysis to follow in the "Current State Assessment."

## Attendees and Roles 
- CISO (Client): Provided insights into current IAM pain points, shared audit findings, and helped validate a shared understanding of the exisiting security posture.
- Chief Technology Officer (CTO) (Client): Contributed strategic perspectives on technology alignment, infrastructure readiness, and implications of cloud migration.
- Human Resources Representative (Client): Offered expertise on workforce identity lifecycles, data quality, and operational processes impacting IAM.
- IAM Architect (Consulting Team): Presented an initial strategic vision emphasizing principles such as Zero Trust, while listening closely to current state challenges. 
- IAM Solution Architect (Consulting Team): Shared preliminary ideas on Microsoft Cloud capabilities (Azure AD/Entra ID) as potential future platforms, without finalizing any decisions. 
- IAM Business Analyst (Consulting Team): Facilitated discussions, ensured accurate capture of current business processes nd pain points, and highlighted operational and governance challenges.
  
  ## Agenda
  1. Introductions and clarification of roles.

  3. Strategic thoughts on technology alignment and cloud migration by CTO and IAM architects, framed as exploration rather than committment. 
  4. Discussion to validate the shared understanding of the current environment, challenges, and constraints.
  5. Initial conversation on project scope and objectives, emphasizing the need for detailed analysis before migration decisions. 
  6. Definition of next steps and focused on detailed information gathering and preparing for subsequent meetings. 
 
  ## Key Discussion points
  - Highlighted current IAM limitations: legacy systems, fragmented directories, manual account provisioning, unclear ownership, and missing SLAs, causing inefficiencies and risks. 
  - Emphasized the importance of aligning all stakeholders on the reality of the current environment to avoid premature assumptions about migration.
  - Validated the value of formal analysis (Current State Assessment) as a prerequisite for migration planning.
  - Discussed strategic objectives in broad terms (modernization, compliance with NIS2, ISO27001, GDPR), stressing that these will be refined post-assessment.
  - Agreed on the need for a clear, accessible Business Requirements Document post-analysis for both technical and non-technical stakholder. 
 
  ## Next steps

  - The IAM consulting team will prepare and deliver an official presentation of the migration roadmap and plan, outlining key phases, milestones, and project governance for client approval.
  - Finalize and deliver the formal Project Charter document.
  - Begin drafting the Business Requirements Document capturing detailed operational and governance requirements.
  - Prepare for the project kickoff meeting with a unified vision and documented agreements.

This first meeting established a solid foundation, transforming high-level ambitions into concrete commitments and setting the stage for a successful IAM migration project.
