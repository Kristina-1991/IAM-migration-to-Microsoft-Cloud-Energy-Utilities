# Kickoff Meeting – Validation of Project Charter and BRD

The kickoff meeting brought together the CIO, CISO, IT Infrastructure leads, business stakeholders, and the consulting IAM team. The session began with introductions and clarification of roles and responsibilities to establish clear lines of communication and accountability.

The purpose of the meeting was to validate the Project Charter and the Business Requirements Document (BRD), ensuring complete alignment across all parties. The CIO confirmed the strategic objectives: modernization of IAM, compliance with GDPR/NIS2, and adoption of Zero Trust. Business stakeholders validated the documented requirements, including onboarding/offboarding SLAs, access governance, external collaboration, IoT/OT integration, and compliance reporting.

A consensus was achieved: all stakeholders agreed that IAM modernization is not just a technical upgrade but a business enabler. Early challenges and success factors were shared openly, setting a tone of transparency and shared commitment.

The team agreed on next steps—transitioning into Phase 2 (Design & Validation), preparing architecture diagrams, defining the governance model, and developing a detailed roadmap. Ongoing collaboration will be ensured via regular progress reviews and milestone tracking.

Outcome
The kickoff officially launched the IAM modernization program. Approval of the Project Charter and BRD provided a clear mandate, shared vision, and foundation for all subsequent project phases.
