# Purpose 
This Business Risks table is developed based on the key vulnerabilities and challenges identified through the comprehensive gap analysis and the defined business requirements. It highlights potential threats that could impact the IAM modernization project and the overall organizational security posture. The inclusion of mitigation strategies reflects a proactive risk management approach aimed at minimizing negative impacts. 
This table ensures that risks are closely monitored and addressed, thereby aligning the project with its strategic goals while safeguarding operational continuity and regulatory compliance.

# IAM Business Analyst Consultant approach 
  
As a Business Analyst consultant, the approach taken involved a thorough analysis of the existing IAM environment to identify key vulnerabilities and gaps. This was combined with detailed mapping of business requirements to ensure that risks were clearly understood and addressed. Emphasis was placed on proactive risk management, with mitigation strategies developed for each identified risk to support operational continuity and regulatory compliance. By aligning risks and requirements with strategic goals and incorporating stakeholder feedback, this method ensures that the IAM modernization project is well-governed, adaptable, and set up for success.
