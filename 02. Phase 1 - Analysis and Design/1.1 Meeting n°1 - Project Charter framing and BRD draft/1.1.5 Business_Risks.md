# Purpose 
This Business Risks table is developed based on the key vulnerabilities and challenges identified through the comprehensive gap analysis and the defined business requirements. It highlights potential threats that could impact the IAM modernization project and the overall organizational security posture. The inclusion of mitigation strategies reflects a proactive risk management approach aimed at minimizing negative impacts. 
This table ensures that risks are closely monitored and addressed, thereby aligning the project with its strategic goals while safeguarding operational continuity and regulatory compliance.

# IAM Business Analyst Consultant approach 
The Business Analyst consultant utilized a structured, data-driven methodology to develop this risks matrix. 
This approach began with an in-depth analysis of the existing gaps and weaknesses identified in the IAM environment and business needs. The consultant correlated these with specific business requirements to pinpoint critical risk areas. 
Key to this effort was the focus on proactive risk management, as emphasized by the detailed mitigation strategies that accompany each risk. This method not only helps ensure alignment with the project’s strategic objectives but also supports continuous operational resilience and adherence to regulatory standards. Ultimately, this approach fosters informed decision-making and collaboration among stakeholders, which is essential to the successful modernization of the IAM framework.
