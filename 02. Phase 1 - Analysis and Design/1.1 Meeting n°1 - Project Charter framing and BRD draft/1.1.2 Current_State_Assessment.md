# Current State Assessment
During the first stakeholder meeting, the IAM consulting team encountered a landscape shaped by rapid digital transformation and growing pains typical of energy sector enterprises.

## 1. Current State
## Legacy Overview
Historically, the company’s IAM systems were architected for a fully on-premises environment, favoring perimeter-based security and supporting users who mostly operated within the corporate network. The post-pandemic shift toward remote work, coupled with the adoption of cloud and SaaS solutions, fundamentally changed the organization’s risk profile, yet the identity infrastructure remains anchored in legacy technologies.

## Operational Overload
Daily operations revealed a team stuck in persistent firefighting. Incident tickets, manual approvals, frequent priority changes, and unclear decision paths slowed progress. Trust eroded between business units and the IAM team, which worked under constant pressure, creating burnout and a chaotic work culture.

## Fragmented IAM Ownership
Discussions exposed unclear and overlapping responsibilities:

- The CISO’s team drove IAM with a compliance and risk mindset.
- The CTO’s group focused on technical enablement and directory services.
- Business units, meanwhile, expected frictionless identity services but faced delays in onboarding and incident response.
This fragmentation led to redundant efforts, lack of accountability, and inconsistent implementation.

## 2. Analysis and Insights
The consulting team identified a clear disconnect between business demands and technical capability.
Key modernization themes emerged:

- **Modern Authentication Standards**

Migrating to Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) brings OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and FIDO2 to the forefront. These standards enable secure cloud access, passwordless login, and resilient identity federation for users and devices, critical for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.​
- **Identity Federation**

The current IAM landscape struggles to unify access between on-premises resources and cloud apps. Introducing federation via Entra ID will allow single sign-on (SSO), seamless partner access, and integration across SaaS, on-premises, and multi-cloud platforms.​
- **Lifecycle Management Automation**

Provisioning, updates, and de-provisioning of both human and non-human identities (employees, contractors, service accounts, APIs) require automated joiner-mover-leaver workflows. Such automation minimizes orphaned accounts, reduces audit risk, and improves operational agility.
- **Change Management Imperative**

The migration journey demands clear communication, targeted training, and process redesign. A structured change management plan will help align IT, security, and business stakeholders, overcoming inertia and building buy-in for new IAM practices.
- **Governance Model**

IAM responsibility often oscillates between IT and security. The team also analyzed the pros and cons of IAM ownership models based on consultancy best practices:

- When IAM is fully managed by the CTO, automation and technical performance improve, but governance and access control may be weaker, often leading to overprivileged accounts detected during audits.
- When IAM is managed solely by the CISO, controls and compliance are strong, but delivery becomes slow and overly manual, hampering user experience and business agility.
 The team recommended creating an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) to unify expertise, clarify SLAs, streamline escalation, and ensure continuous improvement.

**Risks identified include:**
  - Credential theft and lateral movement through poorly governed legacy identities.
  - Inability to meet compliance (GDPR, NIS2) and audit requirements.
  - Loss of efficiency and trust due to manual processes and fragmented ownership.
  - Reputation damage and strategic disadvantage in case of breaches.

## 3. Proposed Resolution
To address these gaps, the IAM team proposed a phased, resilient modernization roadmap:

1. **IAM Landscape Assessment:**
Map current state, dependencies, and pain points to prioritize and sequence modernization.​

2. **Federation Deployment:**
Unify authentication via Entra ID across cloud and on-premises resources, enabling SSO and secure external collaboration.

3. **Lifecycle Automation:**
Implement end-to-end identity lifecycle management (joiner-mover-leaver) for all entity types to ensure timely, secure access provisioning and de-provisioning.

4. **Modern Authentication:**
Roll out Zero Trust architecture and passwordless authentication using Azure Entra’s native standards.

5. **Phased Transition:**
Maintain co-existence of legacy and modern IAM tools during rollout to ensure business continuity.

6. **Analytics and Threat Intelligence:**
Deploy access analytics and anomaly monitoring for proactive risk mitigation.

7. **Change Management Program:**
Launch communications, training, and stakeholder engagement activities to support user adoption and clarify new roles and responsibilities.

8. **IAM CoE Governance Model:**
Formalize a cross-functional team to oversee IAM policy, enforce SLAs, and drive ongoing improvement.

## 4. Decisions
The CIO and core stakeholders validated the diagnosis and recommendations.

The central decision: **migrate identity services to Microsoft Entra ID**, guided by the IAM CoE and a robust change management plan. This strategic move will allow the company to:

- Enhance security and compliance.
- Deliver seamless, secure access for employees, partners, and customers.
- Reduce costs via automation and operational optimizations.
- Accelerate innovation while safeguarding reputation and business growth.
