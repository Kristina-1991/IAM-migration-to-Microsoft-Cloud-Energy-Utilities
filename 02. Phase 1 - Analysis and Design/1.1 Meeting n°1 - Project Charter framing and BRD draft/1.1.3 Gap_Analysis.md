# Gap Analysis

## Purpose
This document identifies the gaps between the company’s current IAM capabilities and industry best practices aligned with Zero Trust principles. It highlights risks, inefficiencies, and areas requiring modernization, forming the basis for the future state vision and roadmap.

---

## Gap 1 – Legacy IAM Architecture vs. Zero Trust
- **Current state:** Monolithic, on-premises IAM solution with limited cloud/SaaS integration.  
- **Best practice:** Cloud-native, federated IAM supporting hybrid environments and modern protocols (SAML, OIDC, FIDO2).  
- **Gap:** Inability to enforce continuous verification and adaptive authentication.  
- **Resolution:** Deploy Microsoft Entra ID federation to unify authentication across cloud and on-premises resources.

---

## Gap 2 – Scalability vs. Explosion of Identities
- **Current state:** IAM cannot scale to manage IoT devices, APIs, and external partners.  
- **Best practice:** IAM platforms must handle human and non-human identities with automation and policy-driven controls.  
- **Gap:** Lack of lifecycle automation for joiners, movers, leavers, and machine identities.  
- **Resolution:** Implement end-to-end identity lifecycle automation using Entra ID and integrate authoritative sources (HR, partner directories).

## Gap 3 – Security Posture vs. Modern Threats
- **Current state:** Password-based authentication vulnerable to credential theft and account takeover.  
- **Best practice:** MFA, passwordless authentication, conditional access, and adaptive risk-based policies.  
- **Gap:** Weak authentication mechanisms expose the organization to modern attack vectors.  
- **Resolution:** Roll out Zero Trust authentication strategy with MFA, passwordless, and adaptive methods.

## Gap 4 – User Experience vs. Business Expectations
- **Current state:** Administrators and end users face outdated, complex, unintuitive IAM interfaces.  
- **Best practice:** Seamless, user-friendly IAM processes with clear SLAs and transparent workflows.  
- **Gap:** Poor UX erodes trust and slows productivity.  
- **Resolution:** Define SLAs (provisioning <4h, offboarding <1h, access requests <1 day) and implement self-service portals with trackable workflows.

---

## Gap 5 – Governance vs. Ownership Conflict
- **Current state:** IAM ownership fragmented between Security, IT Infrastructure, and Business units.  
- **Best practice:** Clear governance model with cross-functional accountability.  
- **Gap:** IAM treated as a political hot potato, slowing decision-making and innovation.  
- **Resolution:** Establish an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) to oversee IAM policy, enforce SLAs, and balance risk, speed, and user experience.

---

## Gap 6 – Compliance vs. Regulatory Requirements
- **Current state:** Legacy IAM lacks capabilities to meet GDPR, NIS2, and ISO 27001 requirements.  
- **Best practice:** IAM must provide auditable evidence of compliance, enforce least privilege, and support periodic access reviews.  
- **Gap:** Inability to demonstrate compliance and readiness for audits.  
- **Resolution:** Implement governance processes for onboarding, access reviews, de-provisioning, and compliance reporting.

---

## Gap 7 – Operational Costs vs. Modernization
- **Current state:** High spending on maintenance, patching, and integrations for legacy IAM.  
- **Best practice:** Modern IAM reduces costs through automation, cloud-native services, and simplified integrations.  
- **Gap:** Resources consumed by legacy maintenance instead of innovation.  
- **Resolution:** Migrate to Microsoft Entra ID, automate provisioning/de-provisioning, and reduce reliance on custom integrations.

## Conclusion
The gap analysis confirms that the current IAM environment is misaligned with Zero Trust principles, regulatory requirements, and business expectations.  
Bridging these gaps requires a phased modernization roadmap that includes federation, lifecycle automation, passwordless authentication, SLA enforcement, governance via IAM CoE, and migration to Microsoft Entra ID.
