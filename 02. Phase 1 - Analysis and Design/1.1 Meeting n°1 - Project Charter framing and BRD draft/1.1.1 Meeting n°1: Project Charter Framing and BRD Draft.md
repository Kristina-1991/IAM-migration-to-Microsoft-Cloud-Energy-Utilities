# Meeting n°1: Project Charter Framing and BRD Draft
## Business context
The first meeting took place between the consulting team and the client’s CISO.  
It was a pivotal moment, setting the tone for the IAM migration project.

The consulting team introduced their roles:  
- **The IAM Architect** outlined the strategic vision and emphasized the importance of aligning with Zero Trust principles.  
- **The IAM Solution Architect** presented initial ideas for leveraging Microsoft Cloud (Azure AD / Entra ID) as the target platform.  
- As the **IAM Business Analyst**, I facilitated the discussion, ensuring that business requirements and operational challenges were clearly captured.

The CISO highlighted the current pain points: 
- IAM legacy,
- fragmented directories,
- manual provisioning,
- lack of clear SLAs,
- and ownership conflicts between Security, IT Infrastructure, and Business units.
These issues had led to operational chaos, eroded trust from the business, and increased risk exposure.

Together, we reviewed the draft Project Charter. The CISO validated the strategic objectives:  
- Modernize IAM in line with regulatory requirements (NIS2, ISO 27001, GDPR).  
- Establish clear service levels for provisioning, offboarding, and incident response.  
- Create an IAM Center of Excellence to resolve ownership conflicts.  
- Formalize a Shared Responsibility Model before migration to the cloud.

The meeting concluded with a clear mandate: the consulting team would finalize the Project Charter as a formal PDF deliverable and begin drafting the Business Requirements Document (BRD). The BRD would capture identity lifecycle needs, authentication and authorization requirements, and governance processes in plain language accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This first exchange laid the foundation for the project. It transformed abstract ambitions into concrete commitments, and gave the IAM team a shared vision to present at the upcoming kickoff meeting.
