# Business Requirement Matrix

## Purpose
This matrix documents the key business requirements for IAM modernization.  
It links each requirement to the relevant business process, system/application, IAM component, and regulatory compliance obligation.  
It serves as a foundation for risk analysis and mitigation planning.
