# IT Challenges

## Purpose
This table highlights the main IT challenges faced by the IAM team in the current environment.  
It explains how operational inefficiencies, technical limitations, and governance gaps create risks and slow down modernization.

| Challenge ID | Challenge Description                                                                 | Business/Operational Impact                                                                 | Mitigation                                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CH-01        | Fragmented identity infrastructure with multiple directories and limited integration | Manual synchronization, inconsistent policies, orphaned accounts, increased risk exposure    | Consolidate identity sources into Microsoft Entra ID and deploy federation for unified authentication        |
| CH-02        | Manual provisioning and de-provisioning of accounts                                   | Delays for new joiners, leavers retaining access, increased security risks                   | Implement automated lifecycle management (joiner-mover-leaver) integrated with HR systems                    |
| CH-03        | Lack of clear SLAs for IAM operations                                                 | Operational chaos, shifting priorities, buried critical work, loss of trust from business    | Define and enforce SLAs (provisioning <4h, offboarding <1h, incident response within 1–8h)                   |
| CH-04        | Ownership conflict between Security, IT Infrastructure, and Business units            | Slow decision-making, unclear accountability, IAM treated as a “political hot potato”        | Establish an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) to balance risk, speed, and user experience                      |
| CH-05        | Outdated authentication mechanisms (password-only)                                    | Vulnerability to credential theft, phishing, account takeover                               | Roll out Zero Trust authentication with MFA, passwordless login, and conditional access                      |
| CH-06        | Poor user experience with outdated, unintuitive IAM interfaces                        | Frustration, reduced productivity, erosion of trust in IT services                          | Deploy self-service portals, passwordless authentication, and transparent workflows                          |
| CH-07        | High operational costs due to legacy IAM maintenance and integrations                 | IT resources consumed by patching instead of innovation, higher total cost of ownership      | Migrate to Microsoft Entra ID, automate provisioning/de-provisioning, and reduce reliance on custom scripts   |
| CH-08        | Limited visibility and monitoring of IAM activities                                   | Delayed anomaly detection, weak incident response, compliance gaps                          | Integrate IAM logs into SIEM (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk) for real-time monitoring and analytics        |

## Conclusion
The IAM team faces significant IT challenges that hinder efficiency, security, and compliance.  
Addressing these challenges requires modernization through automation, federation, Zero Trust authentication, SLA enforcement, and governance via an IAM CoE.  
These improvements will reduce operational chaos, strengthen security, and restore trust between IT and the business.
