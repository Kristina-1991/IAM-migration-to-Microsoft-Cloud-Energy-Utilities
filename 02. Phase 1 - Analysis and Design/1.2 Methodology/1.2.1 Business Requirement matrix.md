# Business Requirement Matrix - Methodology 

The first step of the analysis and design phase consists in drafting the business requirement matrix. This ensures that all critical business needs and regulatory obligations are clearly captured and validated before undertaking the assessment of the current IAM landscape.

I mainly organized interview sessions and collaborative workshops with key stakeholders, and reviewed business needs in alignment with regulatory compliance. I formalize functional and non-functional requirements, as well as constraints, in a clear and validated matrix. This structured documentation allows me to have an exhaustive reference for development, facilitating traceability and stakeholder validation.

The matrix serves as a central tool to ensure alignment between business objectives, IAM components, and regulatory requirements, while also supporting prioritization and dependency management. 
To present all business requirements, I develop a table with the following main columns:
BR ID, Business Process, System/Application, Business Requirement, IAM Component, Regulatory Compliance, Priority, Dependencies or Constraints.

This methodology follows best practices for requirements management by capturing, organizing, and validating requirements iteratively with stakeholders, ensuring completeness, clarity, and alignment to project goals throughout the IAM migration lifecycle.

I maintain the matrix as a living document with version control to manage evolving requirements throughout the project lifecycle. Regular communication and review sessions with stakeholders are conducted to ensure continuous buy-in and alignment, enabling effective collaboration and timely updates to the matrix.
