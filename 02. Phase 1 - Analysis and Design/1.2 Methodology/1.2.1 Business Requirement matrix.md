# Business Requirement Matrix - Methodology 

To draft the business requirement matrix, I mainly organized interview sessions and collaborative workshops with key stakeholders, and reviewed business needs in alignment with regulatory compliance.

I formalize functional and non-functional requirements, as well as constraints, in a clear and validated matrix. This structured documentation allows me to have an exhaustive reference for development, facilitating traceability and stakeholder validation.

The matrix serves as a central tool to ensure alignment between business objectives, IAM components, and regulatory requirements, while also supporting prioritization and dependency management.

To present all business requirements, I develop a table with the following main columns:

- BR ID
- Business Process
- System/Application
- Business requirement
- IAM Component
- Regulatory compliance
- Priority
- Dependencies or constraints

This methodology follows best practices for requirements management by capturing, organizing, and validating requirements iteratively with stakeholders, ensuring completeness, clarity, and alignment to project goals throughout the IAM migration lifecycle.
