# Current state assessment - Methodology
To realise the current statement it's really important to apply methodologies based on best business analyst practices. 
## 1. Data gathering 
As IAM Business Analyst, I organized several interview with stakeholders (IT, security and RH), review current documentation (pentest reports, internal audits, IAM procedures) and fields observations. 
The main objective is to obtain a factual and quantitative vision about the current IAM ecosystem statement. 

## 2. Business process analysis
I also realise several AS IS BPMN which describe the current state of the main business process used within the company. 
Those BPMN will allow me to compare the targeted processes in the "future state vision" section and to highlight the gaps. 

## 3. SWOT Analysis 
I also decided to realise a SWOT analysis. This analysis allows me to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This table give a synthetic and strategic vision to the decision-makers. 

## 4. mapping of systems and responsabilities 

Finally, I decided to realise a mapping of systems and responsabilities. This table is essential to identify the silos, overlaps and unclear areas  of responsibility.
