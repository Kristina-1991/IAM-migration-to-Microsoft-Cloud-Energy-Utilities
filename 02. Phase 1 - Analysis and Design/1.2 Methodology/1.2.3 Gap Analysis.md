# Gap Analysis - Methodology 

The main purpose of the gap analysis is to compare the current state with the target state in close collaboration with stakeholders. To perform the gap analysis, I organize multiple interview sessions with key stakeholders to observe and understand their business processes.

I analyze the impacts, identify functional and technical gaps, as well as governance issues and associated risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that both business and technical dimensions are addressed, and risks are properly evaluated.

The gap analysis allows me to prioritize areas for improvement, define the necessary actions to close the gaps, and align business needs with technical requirements. Throughout the process, continuous collaboration and validation with stakeholders help ensure the findings are accurate and accepted.

To present the results, I create a summary table with the following key columns:

- **Aspect —** the element or process analyzed

- **AS IS —** description of the current state

- **TO BE —** description of the target or desired state

- **Gap Description —** explanation of the differences and deficiencies

- **Priority —** level of urgency or importance for addressing the gap

- **Recommended Action —** proposed measures to resolve the gap

This structured methodology supports transparent communication and facilitates the development of a targeted and effective IAM improvement roadmap.

| IAM Architecture       | Monolithic, on-premises IAM solution with limited cloud/SaaS integration.                                                                                               | Cloud-native, federated IAM supporting hybrid environments and modern protocols (SAML, OIDC, FIDO2).      | Unable to enforce continuous verification and adaptive authentication across hybrid environment.                           | Deploy Microsoft Entra ID federation to unify authentication across cloud and on-premises resources.              |
| Scalability            | Legacy IGA (manual AD group management, on-premises only, no automation for non-human identities). IAM cannot scale to manage IoT devices, APIs, and external partners. | IAM platforms must handle human and non-human identities with automation and policy-driven controls.      | Lack of lifecycle automation for joiners, movers, leavers, and machine identities leading to operational delays and risks. | Implement end-to-end identity lifecycle automation using Entra ID and integrate authoritative sources.            |
| Security Posture       | Password-based authentication vulnerable to credential theft and account takeover.                                                                                      | MFA, passwordless authentication, conditional access, and adaptive risk-based policies.                   | Weak authentication mechanisms expose the organization to phishing, credential theft, and unauthorized access risks.       | Roll out Zero Trust authentication strategy with MFA, passwordless, and adaptive methods.                         |
| User Experience        | Legacy IAM v1 (ticket-based processes, no self-service portal, outdated admin interfaces, poor UX).                                                                     | Seamless, user-friendly IAM processes with clear SLAs and transparent workflows.                          | Poor UX erodes trust and slows productivity, creating resistance and workarounds by users.                                 | Define SLAs (provisioning <4h, offboarding <1h, access requests <1 day) and implement self-service portals.       |
| Governance & Ownership | IAM ownership fragmented between Security, IT Infrastructure, and Business units.                                                                                       | Clear governance model with cross-functional accountability and formal committees.                        | Conflicts and slow decision-making due to unclear roles slow progress and increase risk exposure.                          | Establish an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) to oversee IAM policy, enforce SLAs, and balance risk, speed, and UX. |
| Compliance             | Legacy IAM lacks capabilities to meet GDPR, NIS2, and ISO 27001 requirements.                                                                                           | IAM must provide auditable evidence of compliance, enforce least privilege, and support periodic reviews. | Inability to demonstrate compliance and readiness for audits may cause regulatory penalties.                               | Implement governance processes for onboarding, access reviews, de-provisioning, and compliance reporting.         |
| Operational Costs      | High spending on maintenance, patching, and integrations for legacy IAM.                                                                                                | Modern IAM reduces costs through automation, cloud-native services, and simplified integrations.          | Resources diverted from innovation to maintaining outdated systems increase total cost of ownership.                       | Migrate to Microsoft Entra ID, automate provisioning/de-provisioning, and reduce reliance on custom integrations. |
