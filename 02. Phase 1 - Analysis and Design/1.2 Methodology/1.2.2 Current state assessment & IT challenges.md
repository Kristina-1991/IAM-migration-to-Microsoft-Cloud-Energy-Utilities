## Current State Assessment & IT challenges Methodology

## Problems Identified
To initiate the current state assessment, the starting point is understanding the key challenges and issues faced by the organization in managing its IAM ecosystem. Clear identification of these problems is crucial to guide the evaluation and later transformations.

#### 1. Identity Lifecycle Management
New employees experience onboarding delays of up to 10–14 days before receiving full access. Account provisioning is manual and reliant on IT tickets, leading to errors and inconsistencies. Offboarding processes leave accounts active for days, creating orphan accounts and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, these Joiner/Mover/Leaver workflows are not automated or integrated with HR systems.

#### 2. Access Requests & Approvals
Access is managed via email-based approvals without formal audit trails. There is no self-service portal, forcing users to depend entirely on IT support for access changes. Business units lack visibility on request statuses, creating transparency and compliance issues.

#### 3. Access Reviews & Certifications
Access reviews are performed manually using spreadsheets for only the most critical systems, leaving many SaaS and legacy applications unchecked. The process is error-prone and inconsistent, failing to meet GDPR and NIS2 compliance requirements.

#### 4. Technical Limitations
The organization uses a legacy on-premises IAM platform with limited connectors and no API-first design, making integration with modern SaaS applications difficult. Operational technology identities (SCADA) are unmanaged, and authentication methods are outdated, mostly password-based, increasing phishing risks.

#### 5. Governance & Ownership
IAM ownership is fragmented across IT, Security, and HR, with unclear responsibilities. No Service Level Agreements (SLAs) exist for provisioning or de-provisioning, and governance is reactive and informal without a steering committee.

#### 6. Risk & Compliance
Orphan accounts proliferate in Active Directory and legacy systems. Previous audits revealed weak traceability and control gaps, exposing the organization to GDPR and NIS2 compliance risks. Shadow IT use of SaaS without IAM integration creates security blind spots.

#### 7. User Experience
Users face complex login experiences with multiple credentials and no Single Sign-On (SSO), causing frustration and slow adoption of IAM tools.

## Methodology
To analyze and validate these issues, I apply a structured methodology combining the following components:

### Data Gathering
As an IAM Business Analyst, I conduct interviews with key stakeholders across IT, Security, and HR to gather qualitative insights. I also review current documentation such as pentest reports, audit findings, and IAM procedures, complemented by field observations. The goal is to obtain a factual and quantitative understanding of the IAM ecosystem.Once this information has been gathered, I write a report and a checklist.

### Current State Assessment Report

#### Introduction
This report presents an analysis of the current state of identity and access management (IAM) within the organization. The findings are based on interviews with stakeholders from IT, Security, and HR, a review of pentest reports and internal audits, examination of existing IAM procedures, and direct field observations. The goal is to document current IAM capabilities, identify pain points and risks, and provide a baseline to guide the upcoming IAM migration project.

### Key Problems Identified :

1. **Identity Lifecycle Management**

- Onboarding delays up to 10–14 days; new employees often lack timely access to critical systems.
- Manual provisioning through IT tickets causes errors and inconsistencies.
- Offboarding processes are lagging, leaving orphan accounts active.
- No automation or integration with HR systems for Joiner/Mover/Leaver processes.

2. **Access Requests & Approvals** 

- Access approval relies on email exchanges without audit trails.
- Absence of self-service portals creates bottlenecks and user frustration.
- Lack of transparency for business units on access request status.

3. **Access Reviews & Certifications**

- Reviews are manual, spreadsheet-based, covering only critical systems incompletely.
- Process is error-prone and non-compliant with GDPR and NIS2.

4. **Technical Limitations** 
- Legacy on-premises IAM platform without API-first design impedes cloud and SaaS integration.
- Operational technology identities (e.g., SCADA) are unmanaged.
- Password-based authentication dominates, lacking MFA or passwordless mechanisms.

5. **Governance & Ownership**

- IAM ownership is fragmented across departments.
- No formal SLAs and no structured governance framework such as an IAM steering committee.
- Reactive decision-making often triggered by audit findings.

6. **Risk & Compliance**

- Large number of orphan accounts and weak traceability from prior audit reports.
- Lack of least privilege enforcement and audit readiness for GDPR/NIS2 compliance.
- Shadow IT usage creates security blind spots.

7. **User Experience**

- Complex login processes with multiple credentials and no single sign-on (SSO).
- Low adoption of IAM tools due to inefficiencies and poor user experience.

#### Observations & Notes
- The IAM ecosystem is fragmented and lacks automation, increasing risk exposure.
- Key regulatory compliance requirements are not fully addressed by current processes.
- There is a strong need for modernization and clear governance to support the IAM migration.

### Business Process Analysis
I develop "AS IS" business process models using BPMN to visualize the current workflows involved in identity and access management. This modeling enables a clear comparison with target processes defined later, helping highlight operational gaps and inefficiencies.

### SWOT Analysis
A SWOT analysis synthesizes organizational strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to IAM. This strategic overview provides decision-makers with a comprehensive picture of internal capabilities and external challenges.

### Mapping of Systems and Responsibilities
I create a detailed mapping of IAM systems, applications, and their ownership to identify silos, overlaps, and unclear accountability. This mapping also clarifies governance structures and regulatory compliance contexts.

This combined and iterative methodology ensures a thorough and collaborative current state assessment. It provides a reliable foundation for defining a tailored IAM roadmap and strategy to address the organization’s specific challenges.
