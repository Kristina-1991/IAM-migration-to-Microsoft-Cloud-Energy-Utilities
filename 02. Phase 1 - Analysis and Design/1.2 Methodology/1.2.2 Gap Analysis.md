# Gap Analysis - Methodology 

The main purpose of the gap analysis is to compare the current state with the target state in close collaboration with stakeholders. To perform the gap analysis, I organize multiple interview sessions with key stakeholders to observe and understand their business processes.

I analyze the impacts, identify functional and technical gaps, as well as governance issues and associated risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that both business and technical dimensions are addressed, and risks are properly evaluated.

The gap analysis allows me to prioritize areas for improvement, define the necessary actions to close the gaps, and align business needs with technical requirements. Throughout the process, continuous collaboration and validation with stakeholders help ensure the findings are accurate and accepted.

To present the results, I create a summary table with the following key columns:

- **Aspect —** the element or process analyzed

- **AS IS —** description of the current state

- **TO BE —** description of the target or desired state

- **Gap Description —** explanation of the differences and deficiencies

- **Priority —** level of urgency or importance for addressing the gap

- **Recommended Action —** proposed measures to resolve the gap

This structured methodology supports transparent communication and facilitates the development of a targeted and effective IAM improvement roadmap.
