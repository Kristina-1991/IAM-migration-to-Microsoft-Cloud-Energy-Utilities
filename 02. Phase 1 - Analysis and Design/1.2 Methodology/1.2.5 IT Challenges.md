# IT Challenges - Methodology
To identify IT challenges in the IAM migration project, I mainly:

Review existing IT documentation and system architectures to understand the current environment.

Conduct interviews and workshops with IT and security teams to gather insights on technical limitations and operational difficulties.

Analyze past incidents and known system issues that could affect the migration.

I then categorize the main challenges related to technology, integration, security, and operations to better understand their impact on the project. This helps prioritize the critical issues to address.

This approach combines document review and stakeholder collaboration, providing a practical yet effective way to capture IT challenges relevant to the IAM migration without requiring deep technical expertise.
