# Business risks analysis - methodology 

To identify and assess business risks associated with the IAM migration, I primarily analyze relevant documentation, conduct brainstorming sessions with IAM architects and IT team members, and review past incident reports.

I then perform a risk mapping based on impact and probability, classifying risks to prioritize attention effectively. Following this, I develop a mitigation plan outlining actions to reduce or manage each identified risk.

The main purpose of this business risk assessment is to anticipate and mitigate risks that could compromise the IAM migration and threaten business continuity.

This methodology aligns with IAM migration best practices by combining qualitative insights from expert consultations with quantitative data from documented incidents, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of potential threats and vulnerabilities.
