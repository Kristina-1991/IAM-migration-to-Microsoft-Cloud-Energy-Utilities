# Project Context, Objectives and Scope

## Context
The client’s IT department is launching a strategic initiative to modernize its IAM landscape. Current challenges include fragmented directories, manual processes, unclear ownership, and lack of service levels. Migration to Microsoft Cloud (Azure AD / Entra ID) is chosen to unify IAM, enforce Zero Trust, and support both IT and OT environments.

## Objectives
- Simplify and unify IAM processes across hybrid IT/OT.
- Establish Zero Trust-based authentication and authorization.
- Migrate identities and access from on-prem Active Directory to Azure AD.
- Define and enforce SLAs for provisioning, offboarding, and incident response.
- Create an IAM Center of Excellence to balance risk, speed, and user experience.
- Formalize shared responsibility between cloud provider and company.

## Scope
- **In scope:** Workforce identities, contractors, partners; MFA, RBAC/ABAC; migration AD → Azure AD; integration with enterprise apps; IAM governance processes.
- **Out of scope:** Consumer IAM (CIAM), full IGA implementation, deep OT protocol redesign, non-IAM infrastructure projects.
