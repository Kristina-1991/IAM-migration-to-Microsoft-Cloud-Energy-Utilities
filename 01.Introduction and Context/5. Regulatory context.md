# Regulatory Context

The IAM migration project must comply with the following regulatory and industry standards:

- **NIS2 Directive (EU):** Strengthening cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, including utilities.
- **ISO/IEC 27001:** Establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
- **ISO 50001:** Energy management systems standard, ensuring secure and efficient energy operations.
- **ISO 19443:** Quality management requirements for nuclear energy supply chains, relevant for utilities with nuclear operations.
- **IEC Cybersecurity Guidelines for Smart Energy Systems:** Guidance for securing smart grids, distributed energy resources, and OT environments.
- **GDPR:** Protection of personal data and privacy for employees and contractors.
- **ENISA Energy Sector Guidance:** EU-level best practices for cybersecurity in energy infrastructures.

The IAM strategy aligns with these regulations by:
- Enforcing strong authentication (MFA, conditional access).
- Implementing least privilege and periodic access reviews.
- Documenting governance processes and responsibilities.
- Providing auditable evidence of compliance through centralized IAM reporting.
