# Regulatory Context

The IAM migration project must comply with the following regulatory and industry standards:

- **NIS2 Directive (EU):** Strengthening cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, including utilities.
- **ISO 27001:** Information security management system requirements.
- **GDPR:** Protection of personal data and privacy for employees and contractors.
- **Local energy sector regulations:** Ensuring secure and auditable access to operational technology (OT) systems.
- **Audit and compliance requirements:** IAM processes must be transparent, documented, and regularly reviewed.

The IAM strategy aligns with these regulations by:
- Enforcing strong authentication (MFA, conditional access).
- Implementing least privilege and periodic access reviews.
- Documenting governance processes and responsibilities.
- Providing auditable evidence of compliance through centralized IAM reporting.
