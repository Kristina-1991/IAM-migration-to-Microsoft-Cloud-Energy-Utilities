# Project charter

## Purpose
Modernize the IAM landscape and migrate to Microsoft Cloud (Azure AD / Entra ID) following Zero Trust principles to reduce fragmentation, strengthen governance, and improve user experience across IT and OT environments.

## Scope
- In scope:
  -  Workforce identities,
  - contractors and partners,
  - Authentication (MFA),
  - Authorization (RBAC/ABAC),
  - Access governance,
  - Migration from on-prem AD to Azure AD,
  - Integration with key enterprise apps,
  - PAM alignment,
  - Policy-based access,
  - Foundational IGA capabilities.
  
- Out of scope (for this study case):
   - Consumer identities (CIAM),
   - Full IGA implementation beyond essentials,
   - Custom app re-platforming,
   - Deep OT protocol changes.

## Objectives
- **Unified identity platform:** Consolidate directories and standardize identity lifecycle.
- **Zero Trust:** Enforce strong authentication (MFA, conditional access), least privilege, continuous evaluation.
- **Operational excellence:** Establish SLAs for provisioning, offboarding, access requests, and incident response.
- **Governance:** Create an IAM Center of Excellence and clarify roles/responsibilities.
- **Cloud shared responsibility:** Formalize provider vs. company responsibilities.

## Stakeholders and roles
- **IAM Architect:** Strategy, reference architecture, standards.
- **IAM Solution Architect:** Technical design, integration patterns, product selection.
- **IAM BA Consultant:** Requirements, gap analysis, process design, stakeholder alignment, acceptance criteria.
- **CISO & Security:** Risk, compliance, audit alignment.
- **IT Operations:** Identity operations, device/endpoints, monitoring.
- **Business Units:** Access needs, approvals, process ownership.
- **HR:** Authoritative source for joiners/movers/leavers.

## Success criteria
- **Time-to-access:** New joiners fully provisioned in < 4 hours.
- **Critical access requests:** Completed within 1 business day, trackable.
- **Offboarding:** Access revoked < 1 hour after HR exit signal.
- **Incident response:** Critical 1h, Medium 4h, Low 8h with tracking.
- **Adoption:** 95% workforce using MFA and conditional access policies.
- **Governance:** CoE established with KPIs, charter approved and communicated.

## Constraints and assumptions
- **Constraints:** Legacy dependencies, OT/IT segregation, change management capacity.
- **Assumptions:** HR is authoritative source; Microsoft Cloud available; executive sponsorship in place; phased migration per site/business unit.

## High-level timeline
- Phase 1–2: Analysis, future vision, and validation (8–12 weeks)
- Phase 3: Readiness and migration planning (6–8 weeks)
- Phase 4: Pilot and go-live prep (6 weeks)
- Phase 5: Handover and governance (4 weeks)
