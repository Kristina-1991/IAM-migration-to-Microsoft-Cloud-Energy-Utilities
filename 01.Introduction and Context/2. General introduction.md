# Portfolio Introduction

## Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates the role of a functional IAM consultant in guiding an organization through the migration from a legacy IAM ecosystem to a modern, cloud-native, Zero Trust aligned identity platform.

## Context
- The project is framed as a **migration**: from legacy IAM (manual provisioning, password-based, fragmented ownership) to Microsoft Entra ID and Entra ID Governance.  
- Legacy elements are included intentionally to reflect a realistic scenario, as most organizations face coexistence between outdated IAM and modern requirements.  
- The portfolio follows a **storytelling approach**, showing how challenges are identified, analyzed, and resolved through structured deliverables.

## Project Structure
The portfolio is organized into **five Agile phases**:  
- Analysis & Design
- Design and Validation
- Implementation readiness (including roadmap integrating the 2+2 IAM temporal model)
- Go-live Preparation
- Handover & Governance 

## Consultant Positioning
- The deliverables are designed from the perspective of a **functional IAM consultant**.  
- Focus is placed on **business analysis, governance, compliance, and strategic alignment**, rather than purely technical implementation.  
- Each artifact demonstrates the ability to translate business requirements into IAM solutions, ensuring measurable outcomes and compliance readiness.

## Key Principles
1. Realistic storytelling and context.  
2. Clear understanding of migration projects and their impact.  
3. Structured Agile development phases, enriched with temporal planning (2+2 IAM Model).  
4. Deliverables aligned with the consultant role, emphasizing governance, compliance, and business value.
