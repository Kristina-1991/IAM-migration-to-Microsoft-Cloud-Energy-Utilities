# Portfolio Introduction

## Purpose
"This portfolio showcases an **IAM Consultant (Business Analysis & Strategy)** guiding a utilities organization through a complete IAM transformation from legacy systems to a modern Microsoft Entra ID Zero Trust platform."

## Context
- The project is framed as a **migration**: from legacy IAM (manual provisioning, password-based, fragmented ownership) to Microsoft Entra ID and Entra ID Governance.  
- Legacy elements are included intentionally to reflect a realistic scenario, as most organizations face coexistence between outdated IAM and modern requirements.  
- The portfolio follows a **storytelling approach**, showing how challenges are identified, analyzed, and resolved through structured deliverables.

## Project Structure
The portfolio is organized into **five Agile phases**:  
- Analysis & Design
- Design and Validation
- Implementation readiness 
- Go-live Preparation
- Handover & Governance 

## Consultant Positioning
- The deliverables are designed from the perspective of a **functional IAM consultant**.  
- Focus is placed on **business analysis, governance, compliance, and strategic alignment**, rather than purely technical implementation.  
- Each artifact demonstrates the ability to translate business requirements into IAM solutions, ensuring measurable outcomes and compliance readiness.

## Key Principles

- Realistic storytelling and context.
- Clear understanding of migration projects and their impact.
- Structured Agile development phases, enriched with temporal planning.
- Deliverables aligned with the consultant role, emphasizing governance, compliance, and business value.
