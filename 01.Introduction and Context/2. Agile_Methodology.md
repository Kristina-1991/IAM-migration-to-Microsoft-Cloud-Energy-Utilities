# Agile methodology

## Approach
We apply a pragmatic Agile framework (Scrum/Kanban) with short, outcome-driven increments, focusing on stakeholder validation and risk reduction.

## Cadence
- **Sprints:** 2-week sprints with clear definitions of done and demo-ready outcomes.
- **Backlog:** Prioritized by business value and risk (e.g., MFA policy, conditional access pilots, provisioning flow).
- **Ceremonies:** Planning, daily stand-ups, review/demo, retrospective.
- **Artifacts:** Sprint goal, backlog items with acceptance criteria, burn-up charts.

## Agile guardrails for IAM
- **Plain language artifacts:** Non-technical stakeholders can understand and validate.
- **Incremental pilots:** Start with one BU/site, expand progressively.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** Policy deployed, monitored, documented, and adopted (not just configured).
- **Risk-first sequencing:** Quick wins early (MFA baseline, offboarding automation), complex migrations later.

## Roles and responsibilities in Agile
- **Product Owner (Security/CISO delegate):** Prioritizes backlog, accepts outcomes.
- **IAM BA Consultant:** Facilitates discovery, refines requirements, writes acceptance criteria.
- **IAM Architect/Solution Architect:** Designs increments, ensures coherence with target architecture.
- **IT Ops & Business:** Validate usability and operational processes during demos.
