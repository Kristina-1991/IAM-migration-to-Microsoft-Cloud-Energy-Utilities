# Executive Summary

This study case describes the migration of Identity and Access Management (IAM) capabilities to Microsoft Cloud (Entra ID) for a European energy and utilities provider. 

The initiative is led by a consulting team of three IAM experts:
- **IAM Architect:** Defines strategic vision and alignment with Zero Trust.
- **IAM Solution Architect:** Designs technical solution and integration patterns.
- **IAM Business Analyst (author):** Bridges business needs and technical delivery, ensures governance and process clarity.

The project aims to:
- Modernize IAM by migrating to cloud-based Microsoft Entra ID, aligned with Zero Trust principles.
- Reduce legacy system fragmentation through phased transition and federation of identities.
- Improve operational efficiency by automating identity lifecycle management (joiner, mover, leaver).
- Establish clear SLAs and well-defined governance via an IAM Center of Excellence to resolve operational chaos and restore business trust.
- Implement a structured change management program to drive stakeholder engagement and adoption of new IAM processes.
- Formalize a Shared Responsibility Model for cloud IAM governance to clarify roles across security, IT, and business units.

This portfolio provides concise deliverables across project phases, demonstrating how IAM strategy, design, and governance are applied in practice.
