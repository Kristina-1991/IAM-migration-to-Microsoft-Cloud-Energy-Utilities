# IAM strategy aligned with Zero Trust

## Guiding principles
- **Never trust, always verify:** Enforce strong, adaptive authentication and continuous access evaluation.
- **Least privilege by design:** Role- and attribute-based access with periodic reviews and automated de-provisioning.
- **Policy-driven controls:** Centralized policies with transparent governance and auditability.
- **User experience matters:** Security that doesn’t block productivity; clear SLAs and simple processes.

## Strategic pillars
- **Identity foundation:** Migrate identities to Azure AD / Entra ID; establish authoritative sources and clean joins/moves/leaves.
- **Authentication strategy:** MFA for all, conditional access, device compliance, support for SAML/OIDC/FIDO2.
- **Authorization model:** RBAC/ABAC with standardized entitlements and approval workflows.
- **Operations & SLAs:** Time-bound provisioning, offboarding, and incident response with tracking and reporting.
- **Governance:** IAM Center of Excellence, clear ownership, and a signed Shared Responsibility Model.
- **Integration & tooling:** Leverage Microsoft ecosystem; align with leading tools (SailPoint, Okta, CyberArk) as needed.

## Outcomes
- Reduced risk via consistent policies and clean lifecycle.
- Faster time-to-access, higher trust from business stakeholders.
- Measurable compliance and audit readiness across IT/OT.
