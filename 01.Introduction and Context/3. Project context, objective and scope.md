# Project context, objectives and scope

## Context
The client’s IT department is launching a strategic initiative to modernize its IAM landscape. The current system suffers from fragmented directories, manual processes, unclear ownership, and absence of consistent service levels, leading to operational inefficiencies and business trust erosion. The project addresses these organizational challenges by migrating IAM services to Microsoft Cloud (Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID) to unify identity management, enforce Zero Trust principles, support both IT and OT environments, and establish clear governance mechanisms.

## Objectives
- Modernize IAM by migrating to Microsoft Entra ID with adherence to Zero Trust security principles such as least privilege and continuous verification.

- Simplify and unify IAM processes across hybrid IT and operational technology (OT) environments, including federation of identities for seamless cloud and on-premises access.

- Automate identity lifecycle management (joiner, mover, leaver) for workforce, contractors, and partners to enhance security and operational efficiency.

- Define and enforce clear SLAs for provisioning (<24h), offboarding (<1h), and incident response (<4h) to reduce operational chaos and restore business trust. 
  
- Implement a structured change management program to engage stakeholders, facilitate adoption, and clarify roles and responsibilities.

- Establish an IAM Center of Excellence to centralize governance, balance risk management, user experience, and operational speed.

- Formalize a Shared Responsibility Model for cloud IAM governance to clearly define roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the company.
