# Project Assumptions

The following assumptions guide the IAM migration project:

- **Authoritative source:** The HR system is the single source of truth for joiners, movers, and leavers, with reliable and regularly validated data synchronization processes.

- **Cloud availability:** Microsoft Cloud services (Azure AD, Entra ID, Intune) are licensed, available, and tested for compatibility with existing infrastructure.

- **Executive sponsorship:** Strong and sustained support from the CISO and CIO ensures prioritization, rapid decision-making, and secured funding.

- **Phased migration:** Transition from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD / Entra ID will be executed progressively by business unit, supporting coexistence during migration.

- **Stakeholder engagement:** Business units, IT operations, and security teams will actively engage in workshops, reviews, and validations throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Change management capacity:** Adequate training, communication, and organizational resources are allocated to support user adoption and process transformation.

- **Shared responsibility model:** Clear, documented, and agreed roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the company are in place before migration starts.

- **Modern security adoption:** The organization commits to adopting modern authentication standards (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, FIDO2) and Zero Trust principles throughout the solution.

- **IAM team capacity:** The IAM team has or will acquire the necessary skills and availability to implement lifecycle automation and manage the IAM Center of Excellence.

- **Risk mitigation:** Risks linked to legacy system complexity, overprivileged access, and change resistance will be actively monitored and addressed with dedicated mitigation plans, reviewed regularly.
