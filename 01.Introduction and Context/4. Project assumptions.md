# Project Assumptions

The following assumptions guide the IAM migration project:

- **Authoritative source**: The HR system is the single source of truth for joiners, movers, and leavers, with reliable and regularly updated data.
- **Cloud availability**: Microsoft Cloud services (Azure AD, Entra ID, Intune) are available, licensed, and compatible with existing infrastructure.
- **Executive sponsorship**: Strong and sustained support from the CISO and CIO ensures prioritization, decision-making authority, and funding.
- **Phased migration**: Transition from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD / Entra ID will be executed progressively by site or business unit, with coexistence supported during migration.
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Business units, IT operations, and security teams will actively participate in workshops, reviews, and validations throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Change management capacity**: Adequate training, communication, and organizational resources are allocated to support user adoption and process transformation.
- **Shared responsibility model**: Roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the company will be clearly defined, documented, and agreed upon before migration begins.
- **Modern security adoption**: The organization commits to adopting modern authentication standards (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, FIDO2) and Zero Trust principles as part of the solution.
- **IAM team capacity**: The IAM team possesses or will acquire the skills and availability necessary to implement lifecycle automation and manage the IAM Center of Excellence.
- **Risk mitigation**: Risks related to legacy system complexity, overprivileged access, and change resistance will be actively managed with dedicated mitigation plans.
