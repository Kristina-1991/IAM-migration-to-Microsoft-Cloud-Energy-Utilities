# Project Assumptions

The following assumptions guide the IAM migration project:

- **Authoritative source:** HR system is the single source of truth for joiners, movers, and leavers.
- **Cloud availability:** Microsoft Cloud services (Azure AD, Entra ID, Intune) are available and licensed.
- **Executive sponsorship:** Strong support from CISO and CIO ensures prioritization and funding.
- **Phased migration:** Transition from on-prem AD to Azure AD will be executed progressively by site/business unit.
- **Stakeholder engagement:** Business units, IT operations, and security teams will participate in workshops and validations.
- **Change management capacity:** Training and communication resources are available to support adoption.
- **Shared responsibility model:** Roles between provider and company will be clearly defined and signed before migration.
