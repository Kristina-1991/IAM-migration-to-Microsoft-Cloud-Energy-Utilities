# IAM migration to Microsoft Cloud (Energy/Utilities)

## Overview
This portfolio presents a concise study case of an IAM migration to Microsoft Cloud (Azure AD / Entra ID) for a European energy/utility provider. The initiative modernizes IAM under Zero Trust principles across hybrid IT/OT environments, reducing legacy fragmentation and enabling secure, streamlined access for employees, contractors, and industrial partners.

## Consulting team
- IAM Architect: Defines strategic vision aligned with business, IT strategy, and regulatory standards.
- IAM Solution Architect: Designs technical solution, integration patterns, and product choices (Microsoft, CyberArk, Okta, SailPoint).
- IAM Business/Functional Analyst (author): Bridges business needs and technical delivery. Leads discovery, gap analysis, process design, governance, and stakeholder alignment.

## Objectives
- Simplify and unify IAM processes across hybrid IT/OT.
- Establish a Zero Trust-aligned authentication and authorization model.
- Migrate identities and access from on-prem AD to Azure AD / Entra ID.
- Implement clear SLAs to eliminate operational chaos and improve trust.
- Create an IAM Center of Excellence to resolve ownership conflicts.
- Define a signed Shared Responsibility Model for cloud IAM.
