# Architecture Diagrams – Methodology

## Purpose
Provide a visual representation of the future IAM ecosystem, its governance model, and the key identity flows.  
These diagrams make the target state tangible and facilitate alignment between technical teams, governance, and business stakeholders.

## 1. Macro UML Diagram (IAM Ecosystem)
**Objective:** Show the main components and their interactions.

**Components to include:**  
- **Workday (HR system)** → source of truth for identities.  
- **IAM Core (Microsoft Entra ID + Governance)** → central identity platform.  
- **Applications (SaaS + on-prem)** → consumers of IAM services.  
- **SIEM (Sentinel)** → monitoring and security correlation.  
**Features represented:** provisioning, federation, authentication, compliance integration.

## 2. Governance Diagram (Center of Excellence)
**Objective:** Visualize governance ownership and responsibilities.

**Structure:**  
- Large circle: **IAM Center of Excellence**.  
- Inner circles: **CTO** and **CISO** as core governance leaders.
The CoE acts as a governance hub: it centralises decisions and balances security, UX and operational speed.
- The CTO is responsible for technological consistency and IAM architecture.
- The CISO is responsible for compliance and security.
- The Business Units and HR are consulted to ensure that business needs are integrated.

End users are informed to ensure transparency and adoption.
- **RACI Table:**  
  - Responsible → IAM Architect, Business Analyst.  
  - Accountable → CTO, CISO.  
  - Consulted → HR, Compliance, Business Units.  
  - Informed → End-users, IT support.  
**Output:** Governance diagram + RACI ownership table.

## 3. Identity Flows
**Objective:** Illustrate the main IAM processes in the future state.  
**Flows to represent:**  
1. **Provisioning Flow:** HR → Entra ID → Applications.

3. **Access Request Flow:** User → Self-service portal → Approval workflow → Entra ID.

4. ** 

5. **Certification Flow:** Governance → Entra ID Governance → Reports → Compliance.

6. **Monitoring Flow:** Entra ID logs → SIEM → Security team.
