# Architecture Diagrams – Methodology

## Purpose
Provide a visual representation of the future IAM ecosystem, its governance model, and the key identity flows.  
These diagrams make the target state tangible and facilitate alignment between technical teams, governance, and business stakeholders.

## 1. Macro UML Diagram (IAM Ecosystem)
**Objective:** Show the main components and their interactions.

**Components to include:**  
- **Workday (HR system)** → source of truth for identities.  
- **IAM Core (Microsoft Entra ID + Governance)** → central identity platform.  
- **Applications (SaaS + on-prem)** → consumers of IAM services.  
- **SIEM (e.g., Sentinel, Splunk)** → monitoring and security correlation.  
**Features represented:** provisioning, federation, authentication, compliance integration.  
**Output:** UML component diagram (PDF).

## 2. Governance Diagram (Center of Excellence)
**Objective:** Visualize governance ownership and responsibilities.  
**Structure:**  
- Large circle: **IAM Center of Excellence**.  
- Inner circles: **CTO** and **CISO** as core governance leaders.  
- **RACI Table:**  
  - Responsible → IAM Architect, Business Analyst.  
  - Accountable → CTO, CISO.  
  - Consulted → HR, Compliance, Business Units.  
  - Informed → End-users, IT support.  
**Output:** Governance diagram + RACI ownership table (PDF).

## 3. Identity Flows
**Objective:** Illustrate the main IAM processes in the future state.  
**Flows to represent:**  
1. **Provisioning Flow:** HR → Entra ID → Applications.  
2. **Access Request Flow:** User → Self-service portal → Approval workflow → Entra ID.  
3. **Certification Flow:** Governance → Entra ID Governance → Reports → Compliance.  
4. **Monitoring Flow:** Entra ID logs → SIEM → Security team.  
**Output:** 4 process flow diagrams (PDF).

## Value
- Makes the Future State Vision concrete and visual.  
- Clarifies governance ownership and responsibilities.  
- Demonstrates automation and compliance alignment through clear process flows.  
- Provides stakeholders with a blueprint for roadmap development.
