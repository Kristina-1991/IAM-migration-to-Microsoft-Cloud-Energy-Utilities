# Governance Ownership

The fifth step of the Design and Validation phase is the development of the "Governance Ownership" document. This document defines the roles, responsibilities, and accountability structures essential for sustainable IAM transformation.

To create this governance framework, I collaborated with the IAM Architect, CISO representatives, and business stakeholders to map organizational roles against IAM processes and regulatory requirements. This collaborative approach ensures clear ownership across all levels from strategic governance to operational execution while integrating the Shared Responsibility Model with Microsoft as the cloud provider.

The governance model that follows establishes the IAM Center of Excellence as the central authority, clarifies business unit participation, defines IT operations responsibilities, and formalizes the division of duties between the organization and Microsoft.

---

### 1. IAM Center of Excellence (CoE)
**Role**: Acts as the central authority for IAM standards, methodologies, and continuous improvement.  
**Ownership**: Led by the CTO/CISO, supported by IAM architects and business analysts.  
**Responsibility**: Define IAM policies, oversee lifecycle processes, validate compliance, and coordinate with business units.

---

### 2. Business Units
**Role**: Ensure that access rights reflect actual business needs.  
**Ownership**: Department managers and application owners.  
**Responsibility**: Participate in access reviews, validate entitlements, and escalate issues to the IAM CoE.

---

### 3. IT Operations
**Role**: Operate and maintain IAM platforms (Entra ID, Entra ID Governance, Active Directory).  
**Ownership**: IAM administrators and IT support teams.  
**Responsibility**: Execute provisioning/deprovisioning, enforce SLAs, and monitor incidents via ServiceNow and Sentinel.

---

### 4. Security & Compliance
**Role**: Guarantee that IAM practices align with regulatory and security requirements.  
**Ownership**: Security officers, compliance managers.  
**Responsibility**: Define shared responsibility model, monitor privileged access, and audit IAM processes.

---

### 5. Cloud Provider (Microsoft)
**Role**: Provide secure IAM services and maintain platform availability.  
**Ownership**: Microsoft as vendor.  
**Responsibility**: Ensure uptime, patching, and compliance of Entra ID and Sentinel services.

---

### 6. Shared Responsibility Model
**Definition**: Clarifies the division of responsibilities between the organization and the cloud provider.  
- **Organization**: Identity lifecycle, governance, access reviews, incident response.  
- **Microsoft**: Platform security, infrastructure, availability.  
This model ensures accountability and reduces risk by preventing gaps in ownership.

# Governance Ownership – RACI Matrix

The following RACI matrix defines governance ownership across the main IAM processes.  
It ensures clarity of responsibilities and accountability, reducing risks and improving compliance.
