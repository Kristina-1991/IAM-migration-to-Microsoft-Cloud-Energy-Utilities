# Future State Vision

## Purpose

The Future State Vision defines the target IAM ecosystem that the organization aims to achieve. It provides a strategic narrative aligned with Zero Trust principles, regulatory compliance, and business efficiency. This vision serves as the foundation for architecture design, solution options, and governance alignment.The first step of the Design and Validation phase is to develop the "Future State Vision" document. The main objective of this document is to clearly define the target IAM ecosystem that the organization aims to achieve.

This vision provides a strategic framework aligned with industry best practices such as Zero Trust security principles, regulatory compliance requirements, and operational efficiency goals.

As BA, I led this activity by gathering input from key stakeholders across business, security, and IT domains, ensuring that the vision reflects a holistic view of organizational needs and constraints.

The document typically includes the following elements:

- A clear Purpose that sets the context and objectives.

- Strategic Principles such as security models, technology choices, and automation goals.

- Target Outcomes that articulate desired improvements in security, compliance, efficiency, user experience, and governance.

- The overall Value proposition, emphasizing scalability, user-friendliness, and long-term sustainability.

This methodology ensures that the future state vision serves as the foundational guide for subsequent architecture design, solution evaluation, and governance planning.

## Strategic Principles
1. **Zero Trust Security**  
Enforce least privilege and continuous verification using Conditional Access policies. Adopt passwordless and multi-factor authentication MFA). Ensure secure access across workforce, contractors, and partners with context-aware controls.  

2. **Unified IAM Ecosystem**  
Migrate from legacy IAM to Microsoft Entra ID and Entra ID Governance.  Provide seamless federation across hybrid IT and OT environments.  
Enable single sign-on (SSO) for all critical applications.  

3. **Automation & Efficiency**  
Automate identity lifecycle management (joiner, mover, leaver) including non-human identities (workload identities for service accounts, applications). Reduce onboarding delays and eliminate orphan accounts. Integrate HR, ServiceNow, SCADA, and SIEM systems for end-to-end automation.  

4. **Governance & Compliance**  
Establish an IAM Center of Excellence to centralize governance. Implement structured access certifications aligned with GDPR and NIS2.  
Define clear SLAs for provisioning, offboarding, and incident response.  

5. **Stakeholder Engagement & Change Management**  
Implement a structured change management program. Clarify roles and responsibilities through a Shared Responsibility Model.  
Ensure adoption across business units with transparent communication.

## Target Outcomes
- **Security:** Stronger defense against phishing, orphan accounts, and shadow IT through continuous risk-based access enforcement.   
- **Compliance:** Full alignment with GDPR, NIS2, and audit requirements.  
- **Efficiency:** Reduced manual effort, faster onboarding, and improved incident response.  
- **User Experience:** Simplified login experience with SSO and passwordless authentication.  
- **Governance:** Clear ownership, accountability, and centralized IAM expertise.

## Value
The Future State Vision provides a clear, validated target for IAM modernization.  
It ensures that the organization’s identity ecosystem is secure, compliant, efficient, and user-friendly, while enabling scalability for future business needs.
