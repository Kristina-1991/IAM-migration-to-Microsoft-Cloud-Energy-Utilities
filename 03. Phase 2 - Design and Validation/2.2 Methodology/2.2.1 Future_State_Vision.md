## Strategic Principles
1. **Zero Trust Security**  
Enforce least privilege and continuous verification using Conditional Access policies. Adopt passwordless and multi-factor authentication MFA). Ensure secure access across workforce, contractors, and partners with context-aware controls.  

2. **Unified IAM Ecosystem**  
Migrate from legacy IAM to Microsoft Entra ID and Entra ID Governance.  Provide seamless federation across hybrid IT and OT environments.  
Enable single sign-on (SSO) for all critical applications.  

3. **Automation & Efficiency**  
Automate identity lifecycle management (joiner, mover, leaver) including non-human identities (workload identities for service accounts, applications). Reduce onboarding delays and eliminate orphan accounts. Integrate HR, ServiceNow, SCADA, and SIEM systems for end-to-end automation.  

4. **Governance & Compliance**  
Establish an IAM Center of Excellence to centralize governance. Implement structured access certifications aligned with GDPR and NIS2.  
Define clear SLAs for provisioning, offboarding, and incident response.  

5. **Stakeholder Engagement & Change Management**  
Implement a structured change management program. Clarify roles and responsibilities through a Shared Responsibility Model.  
Ensure adoption across business units with transparent communication.
