
# Solution Options – Methodology

## Purpose 
To address the organization’s identity and access management (IAM) challenges, the consulting team has developed a comprehensive set of solution options. 
These options combine mandatory transversal initiatives such as standardized IAM processes, the establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE), clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs), a Shared Responsibility Model, and the management of non-human identities with different migration strategies.
The transversal initiatives are non-negotiable and must be applied across all scenarios to ensure governance, compliance, and operational maturity. 
The migration strategies, however, represent the technical variable, offering different paths depending on organizational priorities such as cost, complexity, vendor dependency, and scalability.
The following table outlines the proposed solution options, highlighting how each migration approach integrates with the transversal IAM initiatives, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

## Solution Options – Table

| Migration Option          | Transversal Initiatives Applied                                    | Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Stack**       | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Native integration, strong Microsoft support, cloud scalability, enhanced security | Strong vendor dependency, licensing costs |
| **Hybrid IAM**            | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Flexibility, advanced governance, better multi-cloud coverage | Higher integration complexity, increased costs |
| **Minimal IAM**           | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Simplicity, reduced costs, fast deployment | Limited compliance, no automated certifications, low maturity |
| **Best of Breed Hybrid**  | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Comprehensive coverage with Workday (HR), Microsoft Entra ID + Active Directory (hybrid identity), Entra ID Governance, Sentinel; strong compliance, robust security posture, and scalable architecture | High complexity, multi-vendor dependency, significant budget |



## Justification of the Recommended Option

After evaluating migration strategies against transversal IAM initiatives, the Best of **Breed Hybrid** option is the most suitable for long-term IAM transformation.

**Recommended Architecture:** Workday (HR source of truth), Microsoft Entra ID + Active Directory (hybrid identity/SSO), Entra ID Governance (access reviews, entitlement management), Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM/monitoring).

**Key Justifications:**

- Security & Compliance: Entra ID Governance + Sentinel ensure regulatory alignment (GDPR, NIS2) with automated reviews and continuous monitoring.
- Hybrid Reality: Active Directory supports legacy OT/SCADA systems while Entra ID enables modern cloud authentication.
- Scalability: Workday integration provides reliable identity source with flexibility for future growth.
- Risk Management: Non-human identities and Shared Responsibility Model reduce service account risks.

**Comparison:**

- Microsoft Stack: Simple but vendor lock-in
- Hybrid IAM: Flexible but complex
- Minimal IAM: Cheap but immature
- **Best of Breed Hybrid:** Optimal balance for regulated hybrid environments

This approach delivers security, compliance, and operational resilience for the energy/utilities sector.
