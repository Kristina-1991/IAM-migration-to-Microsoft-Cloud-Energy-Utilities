
# Solution Options – Methodology

## Purpose 
To address the organization’s identity and access management (IAM) challenges, the consulting team has developed a comprehensive set of solution options. 
These options combine mandatory transversal initiatives such as standardized IAM processes, the establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE), clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs), a Shared Responsibility Model, and the management of non-human identities with different migration strategies.
The transversal initiatives are non-negotiable and must be applied across all scenarios to ensure governance, compliance, and operational maturity. 
The migration strategies, however, represent the technical variable, offering different paths depending on organizational priorities such as cost, complexity, vendor dependency, and scalability.
The following table outlines the proposed solution options, highlighting how each migration approach integrates with the transversal IAM initiatives, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

## Solution Options – Table

| Migration Option          | Transversal Initiatives Applied                                    | Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Stack**       | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Native integration, strong Microsoft support, cloud scalability, enhanced security | Strong vendor dependency, licensing costs |
| **Hybrid IAM**            | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Flexibility, advanced governance, better multi-cloud coverage | Higher integration complexity, increased costs |
| **Minimal IAM**           | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Simplicity, reduced costs, fast deployment | Limited compliance, no automated certifications, low maturity |
| **Best of Breed Hybrid**  | - Standardized IAM processes<br>- IAM Center of Excellence<br>- SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Non-human identity management | Comprehensive coverage with Workday (HR), Microsoft Entra ID + Active Directory (hybrid identity), Entra ID Governance, Sentinel; strong compliance, robust security posture, and scalable architecture | High complexity, multi-vendor dependency, significant budget |



## Justification of the Recommended Option

After evaluating the different migration strategies against the transversal IAM initiatives, the Best of Breed option remains the most suitable choice for the organization’s long‑term identity and access management transformation.

This option combines Workday (HR source of truth), Microsoft Entra ID (SSO and federation), Microsoft Entra ID Governance (access reviews, entitlement management, privileged identity management), and Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM and monitoring). When integrated with the transversal solutions—standardized IAM processes, establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence, clear SLAs, a Shared Responsibility Model, and management of non‑human identities—it provides a comprehensive and resilient framework.

The justification for this recommendation is threefold:

1. **Security and Compliance**

- Entra ID Governance ensures strong alignment with regulatory requirements through native access reviews and entitlement management.
- Combined with Sentinel and a Shared Responsibility Model, it provides robust monitoring and clear accountability.

2. **Scalability and Flexibility**

- By integrating specialized Microsoft services with Workday, the organization gains flexibility to adapt to future needs while keeping integration complexity low.
- Standardized IAM processes and the CoE guarantee that this complexity is managed effectively.

3. **Risk Mitigation and Business Value**

- Managing non‑human identities within this architecture reduces hidden risks associated with service accounts and workloads.
- SLAs and governance structures ensure that IAM services deliver consistent value to business units and end‑users.

While the Microsoft Stack option offers simplicity and native integration, it creates a strong vendor dependency. The Hybrid IAM option provides balance but introduces integration overhead. The Minimal IAM option is cost‑effective but insufficient for compliance and long‑term maturity.

Therefore, the Best of Breed with Microsoft Entra ID Governance is the most effective path to achieve a secure, compliant, and future‑proof IAM environment.
