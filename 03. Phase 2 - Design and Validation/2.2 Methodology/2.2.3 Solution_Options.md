## Purpose 
To address the organization’s identity and access management (IAM) challenges, the consulting team has developed a comprehensive set of solution options. 
These options combine mandatory transversal initiatives—such as standardized IAM processes, the establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE), clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs), a Shared Responsibility Model, and the management of non-human identities—with different migration strategies.
The transversal initiatives are non-negotiable and must be applied across all scenarios to ensure governance, compliance, and operational maturity. 
The migration strategies, however, represent the technical variable, offering different paths depending on organizational priorities such as cost, complexity, vendor dependency, and scalability.
The following table outlines the proposed solution options, highlighting how each migration approach integrates with the transversal IAM initiatives, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

| **Migration Option** | **Description** | **Transversal Solutions (Always Applied)** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Microsoft Stack       | Full migration to Microsoft Entra ID + Entra ID Governance + Active Directory + Sentinel | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Native integration, strong Microsoft support, cloud scalability, enhanced security | Strong dependency on Microsoft, licensing costs |
| Hybrid IAM            | Entra ID for federation + third-party tool (e.g., SailPoint, OneIdentity) for governance | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Flexibility, advanced governance, better multi-cloud coverage | Higher integration complexity, increased costs |
| Minimal IAM           | Entra ID + Active Directory without advanced governance features | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Simplicity, reduced costs, fast deployment | Limited compliance, no automated certifications, low maturity |
| Best of Breed         | Combination of Workday (HR), Entra ID (SSO), SailPoint (Governance), Sentinel (SIEM) | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Comprehensive coverage, strong compliance, robust security posture | High complexity, multi-vendor dependency, significant budget requirements |
