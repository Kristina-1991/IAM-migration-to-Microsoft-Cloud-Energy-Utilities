## Purpose 
To address the organization’s identity and access management (IAM) challenges, the consulting team has developed a comprehensive set of solution options. 
These options combine mandatory transversal initiatives—such as standardized IAM processes, the establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE), clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs), a Shared Responsibility Model, and the management of non-human identities—with different migration strategies.
The transversal initiatives are non-negotiable and must be applied across all scenarios to ensure governance, compliance, and operational maturity. 
The migration strategies, however, represent the technical variable, offering different paths depending on organizational priorities such as cost, complexity, vendor dependency, and scalability.
The following table outlines the proposed solution options, highlighting how each migration approach integrates with the transversal IAM initiatives, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

| **Migration Option** | **Description** | **Transversal Solutions (Always Applied)** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Microsoft Stack       | Full migration to Microsoft Entra ID + Entra ID Governance + Active Directory + Sentinel | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Native integration, strong Microsoft support, cloud scalability, enhanced security | Strong dependency on Microsoft, licensing costs |
| Hybrid IAM            | Entra ID for federation + third-party tool (e.g., SailPoint, OneIdentity) for governance | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Flexibility, advanced governance, better multi-cloud coverage | Higher integration complexity, increased costs |
| Minimal IAM           | Entra ID + Active Directory without advanced governance features | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Simplicity, reduced costs, fast deployment | Limited compliance, no automated certifications, low maturity |
| Best of Breed         | Combination of Workday (HR), Entra ID (SSO), SailPoint (Governance), Sentinel (SIEM) | - Clear & standardized IAM processes<br>- Establishment of IAM CoE<br>- Definition of SLAs<br>- Shared Responsibility Model<br>- Management of non-human identities | Comprehensive coverage, strong compliance, robust security posture | High complexity, multi-vendor dependency, significant budget requirements |

# Justification of the Recommended Option
After evaluating the different migration strategies against the transversal IAM initiatives, the Best of Breed option emerges as the most suitable choice for the organization’s long‑term identity and access management transformation.

This option combines Workday (HR source of truth), Microsoft Entra ID (SSO and federation), SailPoint (advanced governance), and Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM and monitoring). When integrated with the transversal solutions—standardized IAM processes, establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence, clear SLAs, a Shared Responsibility Model, and management of non‑human identities—it provides a comprehensive and resilient framework.

The justification for this recommendation is threefold:

1. **Security and Compliance**

- Best of Breed ensures strong alignment with regulatory requirements by leveraging SailPoint’s advanced certification and governance capabilities.

- Combined with Sentinel and a Shared Responsibility Model, it provides robust monitoring and clear accountability.

2. **Scalability and Flexibility**

- By integrating multiple specialized platforms, the organization gains flexibility to adapt to future needs, including multi‑cloud environments and complex business processes.

- Standardized IAM processes and the CoE guarantee that this complexity is managed effectively.

3. **Risk Mitigation and Business Value**

- Managing non‑human identities within this architecture reduces hidden risks associated with service accounts and workloads.

- SLAs and governance structures ensure that IAM services deliver consistent value to business units and end‑users.

While the Microsoft Stack option offers simplicity and native integration, it creates a strong vendor dependency and limits governance flexibility. The Hybrid IAM option provides balance but introduces integration overhead. The Minimal IAM option is cost‑effective but insufficient for compliance and long‑term maturity.

Therefore, the Best of Breed approach, supported by transversal governance and process solutions, is the most effective path to achieve a secure, compliant, and future‑proof IAM environment.
