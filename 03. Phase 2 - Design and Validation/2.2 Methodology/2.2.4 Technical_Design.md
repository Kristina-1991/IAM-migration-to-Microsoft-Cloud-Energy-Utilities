# Technical Design

The technical design describes the key IAM components that form the target architecture and explains their role through concrete use cases. This section ensures that the solution is not only conceptual but also technically grounded.

### 1. Workday (Source of Truth)
**Definition**: Workday serves as the authoritative source of HR data, providing identity attributes such as employee status, department, and role.  
**Concrete Case**: When a new employee is onboarded in Workday, the system triggers the creation of a digital identity in Microsoft Entra ID, automatically provisioning access to required applications.

### 2. Microsoft Entra ID
**Definition**: Entra ID is the core identity platform, enabling authentication, federation, and provisioning across cloud and on-premises applications.  
**Concrete Case**: A user changing roles in Workday (Mover process) automatically updates their Entra ID group memberships, ensuring that access rights are adjusted without manual intervention.

### 3. Microsoft Entra ID Governance
**Definition**: Entra ID Governance provides governance capabilities such as access reviews, entitlement management, and privileged identity management.  
**Concrete Case**: A quarterly access review is launched for the Finance department. Managers validate user access directly in Entra ID Governance, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

### 4. Active Directory
**Definition**: Active Directory remains the directory service for legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure. It integrates with Entra ID to provide hybrid identity management.  
**Concrete Case**: A legacy ERP system requires on-premises authentication. The user logs in via Entra ID, which federates credentials with Active Directory to grant seamless access.

### 5. Microsoft Sentinel
**Definition**: Sentinel is the cloud-native SIEM solution used for monitoring, detecting anomalies, and correlating security events across the IAM ecosystem.  
**Concrete Case**: Sentinel detects multiple failed login attempts from an unusual location. An alert is generated, and the IAM team investigates the incident using Entra ID logs and ServiceNow integration.

### Conclusion

Together, these components form a secure, compliant, and future‑proof IAM architecture.  
Workday ensures a reliable source of truth for identity data, while Microsoft Entra ID provides seamless authentication and provisioning across applications. Entra ID Governance enforces compliance through access reviews and entitlement management, Active Directory supports legacy integration in hybrid environments, and Microsoft Sentinel delivers continuous monitoring and incident detection.  

By combining these technologies with transversal governance initiatives—standardized IAM processes, the establishment of an IAM Center of Excellence, clear SLAs, a Shared Responsibility Model, and the management of non‑human identities—the organization achieves a holistic IAM framework. This design not only addresses current gaps but also positions the enterprise for long‑term scalability, regulatory compliance, and operational resilience.
